			<h1>Bio</h1>
			I'm a second-year PhD student in computer science at Stanford University, where I am advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/">Stefano Ermon</a> in the <a href="http://statsml.stanford.edu">Statistical Machine Learning Group</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> in the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Natural Language Processing Group</a>. <br>

			<!-- I am working on novel representation learning and learning objectives for deep generative models. I am working towards more reasonable, interpretable, and equitable machine learning.  -->

			<!-- this motivates novel representation learning and learning objectives for deep generative models. -->

			<span class="highlight">I am interested in reasoning inside deep generative models.</span> As a result, I work on learning (disentangled) representations, novel learning objectives, and interpretability. I'm also interested in envisioning more <a href="https://twitter.com/riakall/status/1091063916120150016">radical AI.</a>
			<!-- I'm interested in designing and analyzing <i>representation learning</i> and <i>suitable learning objectives</i> that enable machine learning models in general and deep generative models in particular to reason better.

			<!-- I'm particularly interested in AI for fairness, accountability, and transparency, as well as equity and co-liberation. -->
			<!-- I'm deeply committed to disentangled, interpretable, and equitable machine learning. -->
			<br>
			<br>
			Previously, I interned at Microsoft (2014), completed my bachelors in computer science at MIT (2016), and was a visiting researcher at University Complutense in Madrid (2017), where I built symbolic and probabilistic models of human reasoning.
			I have received the <a href="https://www.pdsoros.org/">Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship</a>, the <a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate">Stanford EDGE Fellowship</a>, the Stanford School of Engineering Fellowship, and the <a href="https://joininteract.com/">Interact Fellowship</a>.
