			<h1>Bio</h1>
			I'm a second-year PhD candidate in computer science at Stanford University, where I am advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/">Stefano Ermon</a> in the <a href="http://statsml.stanford.edu">Statistical Machine Learning Group</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> in the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Natural Language Processing Group</a>.

			I'm interested in enabling machine learning models to reason better, which motivates my current work designing representation learning and suitable learning objectives, particularly in deep generative models.
			<!-- I'm interested in designing and analyzing <i>representation learning</i> and <i>suitable learning objectives</i> that enable machine learning models in general and deep generative models in particular to reason better.

			I'm also interested in AI for fairness, accountability, and transparency, as well as equity, co-liberation, and reflexivity.

			<br>
			Previously, I interned at Microsoft (2014), completed my bachelors in computer science at MIT (2016), and was a visiting researcher at University Complutense in Madrid (2017).
			<br>
			<br>
			I am a recipient of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship, the Stanford EDGE Fellowship, the Stanford School of Engineering Fellowship, and the Interact Fellowship.
