Towards a transfeminism
Wrong body is a resistant move. There is a third story.
Remaining questions: What is the third story? What work does feminism need to do be a true transfeminism? I might say negotiate away the story that underesourced folks are unagentic. Negotiate away the story that underesourced folks are unagentic and must pretend to be unagentic in order to be truly underesourced and must pretend to be unagentic in order to receive resources.
